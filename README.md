Welcome to the Katas Repository!

In our CodeJourneys Community, members have expressed the desire to have common JavaScript exercises posted each week,
for which we share a solution later that same week. Anyone who has also solved it is invited to post their own solutions
and so a discussion can begin and questions can be asked and answered. The exercises are starting out at the beginner 
level and the source is normally codewars.com, but we hope to increase the difficulty as we all grow in our abilities
together :) 

So, join us and post your own solutions or comment and ask questions about the posted ones you see! We hope this will be
helpful!
